/**
 * @brief Brief description of the function create_split.
 * 
 * Detailed description of the function, including its purpose, behavior, and any important details.
 * Mention any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies.
 * 
 * @param param1 s is the line to be split.
 * @param param2 split is where the splitted line will be stored.
 * @param param3 the total number of words to be splitted (obtained in count words).
 * @param param4 is the main delimiter, in this case " ".
 * 
 * @return Return value is the splitted array.
 * 
 * @note Any additional notes about the function, such as error handling, performance considerations, etc.
 *  This function splits a sentence by words, considering the space as a delimiter, however if the function encounters quotes,
 *  it will consider all the words between the quotes as one single word, and will store them as such
 * @warning Any warnings or caveats about using the function.
 * 			function create_split is too big!!
 * @see Any related functions, structures, or documentation.
 * 
 * @example Example usage of the function.
 * 
 * ```
 * // Example code demonstrating how to use the function
 * // Include any necessary setup or input/output
 * // Provide comments to explain the example
